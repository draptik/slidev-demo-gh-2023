# Showcase: Publish slidev presentation from subfolder to Github Pages

- Folder `presentation-demo` contains the default [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) presentation. This is our `<subfolder>`.
- File [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) contains the github actions for publishing to github pages. In
  addition to the [official documentation](https://sli.dev/guide/hosting.html#github-pages), there
  are some extra `cd <subfolder>` instructions in the `run` statements. The `build-dir` assignment is also prepended by the `<subfolder>`.

## Prerequisites

Web UI of Github Repo

- Settings -> Pages -> Branch: Choose "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" in drop-down menues, and save.
- Ensure that GH-Actions has the required permissions: Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions: Read and Write permissions
